What is the story of my store
<br/>
I have been designing and editing images ever since I first discovered Microsoft Paint on my new computer back in the '90s! The designs you see here have been printed/cut into paper or vinyl and have been used at Indian weddings, baby and bridal showers that I have hosted, given out as gifts by me or used in my children's school for Inclusive Schools Week. I am sharing them with the world in the hopes that another creative person can take them and print or cut their own.
I take pride in creating beautiful downloadable and printable files. If you need something custom made feel free to reach out using the contact page or any of the social media accounts. I would love to create a unique design for you.
