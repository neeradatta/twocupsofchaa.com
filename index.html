					<h2><strong>Mom by day, digital designer by night, caffeinated always</strong> .</h2>
				</header>
				<p>I have been designing and editing images ever since I first discovered Microsoft Paint on my new
					computer back in the '90s. The designs you see here have been cut into paper or vinyl and have been
					printed to be used at Indian weddings, baby and bridal showers that I have hosted, given out as
					gifts by me or used in my children's school for Inclusive Schools Week..</p>

					</header>
					<p>Meet our Noble Elephant! For as far back as I can remember I have been in awe of elephants.
						Elephants are strong, powerful yet graceful animals. When I see an image or have the rare
						pleasure of seeing an elephant they bring me so much peace. My elephant art collection is
						inspired by the figurines and paintings I have either been given or collected over the years.

						<h3>The Reds Collection</h3>

					<p>The Reds Collection is a selection of files that I have put together to help you put together
						different aspects of your wedding. While the images are through an Indian lens they can
						certainly be used for events of all kinds. The collection will help you with the signage and
						printed parts of the wedding. The collection has everything from Bridal Shower and Sangeet
						invitations to signs to help direct the flow of guests on the day. The first part of the
						collection will be listed as printables. The second part of this collection will be editable,
						which means you can personalize the file to fit your event..</p>
