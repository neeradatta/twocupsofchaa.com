					<p>Meet our Noble Elephant! For as far back as I can remember I have been in awe of elephants.
						Elephants are strong, powerful yet graceful animals. When I see an image or have the rare
						pleasure of seeing an elephant they bring me so much peace. My elephant art collection is
						inspired by the figurines and paintings I have either been given or collected over the years.

					<p>	Meet George he is my silly smiling
						giraffe. Giraffes are marvelous and tall creatures! A giraffe made it into my collection
						because my eldest child collected them when she was little. I loved elephants, she loved
						giraffe’s – it was an awesome mommy-daughter duo! While her tastes have changed this still
						remains an animal that is near and dear to my heart.

					<p>Meet Paquito my Majestic Peacock, he is an incredibly beautiful and proud peacock I had the good fortune of meeting recently. While Paquito doesn’t usually dance for strangers he did for me. It was a truly breathtaking moment that I won’t ever forget – I am in awe of the closeup pictures and videos he allowed me to take of him dancing. I have always been drawn to animals who walk this earth with grace, this peacock was no exception. He knows he is magnificent!</p>

					<p>The Reds Collection is a selection of files to help you put together
						different aspects of your wedding. While the images are through an Indian lens they can

						invitations to signs to help direct the flow of guests on the day. The first part of the
						collection will be listed as printables. The second part of this collection will be editable,
						which means you can personalize the file to fit your event..</p>

				<p>I have been designing and editing images ever since I first discovered Microsoft Paint on my new

					printed to be used at Indian weddings, baby and bridal showers that I have hosted, given out as
					gifts by me or used in my children's school for Inclusive Schools Week..</p>
