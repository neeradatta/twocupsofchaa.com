										<h3>Peacock Collection</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This is Paquito my Majestic Peacock, he is an incredibly beautiful and proud peacock I had the good fortune of meeting recently. While Paquito doesn’t usually dance for strangers he did for me. It was a truly breathtaking moment that I won’t ever forget – I am in awe of the closeup pictures and videos he allowed me to take of him dancing. I have always been drawn to animals who walk this earth with grace, this peacock was no exception. He knows he is magnificent! Peacocks love the limelight, the sight of a dancing peacock is something you don’t forget. The males sport highly ornamental feathers in their train. As an artist, there are so many details to pull from when working with this animal. When designing this peacock, I wanted to feature the eyes in his plumage and showcase how big his train is. I hope he brings you as much joy as he does to me.</p>

									<h3>The Elephant Collection</h3>
									<p>Meet our Noble Elephant! For as far back as I can remember I have been in awe of elephants. Elephants are strong, powerful yet graceful animals. When I see an image or have the rare pleasure of seeing an elephant they bring me so much peace. My elephant art collection is inspired by the figurines and paintings I have either been given or collected over the years. </p>

									<h3>The Giraffe Collection</h3>
									<p>Meet Geoffrey, he is my silly smiling goofy giraffe design. Giraffes are marvelous, tall and proud creatures! Giraffes are the world’s tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe’s legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances. This giraffe is in here because my eldest child collected them when she was little. I loved elephants, she loved giraffe’s – it was an awesome mommy-daughter duo! While her tastes have changed this remains an animal that is near and dear to my heart.</p>
