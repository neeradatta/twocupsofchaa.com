# Two Cups Of Chaa

This is the origin story of two cups of chaa. I hope you enjoy it.

## The what
This store was built during the global pandemic but it hold work that has evolved over the years. From decorating tips to printable and customizable wedding signage and stationary we hope to meet your needs, make it a simple easy process and help elevate your event by several notches! 

 The designs you see here have been printed/cut into paper or vinyl and have been used at Indian weddings, baby and bridal showers as well as printed, framed and then given out as gifts. We are now sharing them with the world in the hopes that another creative person can take them and print or cut their own. We would love to create a unique design for you. Check out the collections below or contact us through the etsy storefront.

## The why: 
Growing up we went to weddings and have always loved the pomp and ceremony that is put into our celebrations. As young kids we remember seeing the bright colors on our outfits and our jewelry, everyone brings their “A game!” We smell that wonderful smell of food being cooked in the Bridal house to prepare for all the guests that will stop by. Indian, western or fusion : having a wedding in the house is lovely – but it takes a lot to put it all together.
