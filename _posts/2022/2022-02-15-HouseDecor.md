# Entrance and Banister Decor
## Decorate with flowers
>You can easily adorn any interior or outdoor entryway with store-bought flower garlands. Garlands can be found at most craft or fabric stores. One thing to keep in mind is that these garlands may be linked together to create a single long string of flowers to work with.

>  - Wrap the flowers around the handrail in a circular fashion.
<br/>
>
>  -  Use fishing wire or grocery bag ties to attach the flower garlands to the top of the railing. *Tip: Use gold or green wire and ties to mix in with the decorations.
<br/>
>
>  - Attach the flower garlands to the handrail's bottom. This solution is perfect since it frees up the real railing for individuals, particularly the elderly. When you're on a stairwell, use this approach.
