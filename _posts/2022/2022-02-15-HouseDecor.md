# Home or small space decorations

>Wondering how to bring that level of elegance and sophisication while tying in your wedding colors or wedding theme? 
>Getting the house ready for a home-based wedding or party event is a major source of stress. It's a lot to clean up the space, mend items that need fixing, and move furniture around to enhance people flow. You have to worry about deocrating on top of it all? Who has that kind of time? You want it to seem elegant and professional, but you don't have the funds or time to do it. We've put together some pointers to help you make the most of your time while still achieving a finished look that is warm, welcoming, and stunning!

The following suggestions are for decorating an Indian wedding sangeet, but they may be used to any sort of celebration.

# Entrance and Banister Decor
## Decorate with flowers
>You can easily adorn any interior or outdoor entryway with store-bought flower garlands. Garlands can be found at most craft or fabric stores. One thing to keep in mind is that these garlands may be linked together to create a single long string of flowers to work with.

>  - Wrap the flowers around the handrail in a circular fashion.
<br/>
>
>  -  Use fishing wire or grocery bag ties to attach the flower garlands to the top of the railing. *Tip: Use gold or green wire and ties to mix in with the decorations.
<br/>
>
>  - Attach the flower garlands to the handrail's bottom. This solution is perfect since it frees up the real railing for individuals, particularly the elderly. When you're on a stairwell, use this approach.
