description: Meet our Noble Elephant! For as far back as I can remember I have been in awe of elephants. Elephants are strong, powerful yet graceful animals. When I see an image or have the rare pleasure of seeing an elephant they bring me so much peace. My elephant art collection is inspired by the figurines and paintings I have either been given or collected over the years.
