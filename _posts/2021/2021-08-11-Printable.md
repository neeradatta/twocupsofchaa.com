How do you print at home and why should you do it? If you want to use digital downloads and print your own gift, note or paper product for your event you have come to the right place.  


> # Editing and printing at home has never been this easy

## What are digital downloads
Digital downloads are files that you purchase online with the intent to use. Our files are available in PDF, PNG and SVG formats. 



Here is a link to Etsy's Download Guide [Click here](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013328108-Downloading-a-Digital-Item?segment=shopping).

## What is the difference between a digital download and an Electronic Virtual Invitation?
A digital download is a file you purchase and download to your own device. An online template such as the editable templates we provide are sent via a link.

Once you have completed your purchase the link to your virtual invitation will be there for you to edit and save your own file.

When you are happy with your file you can print on your own device, send the file to a printer or use the print features via Canva.
