## ☕ What is the story of this Contemporary? ☕
>The Contemporary Collection is a selection of files that I have put together to help you put together different aspects of your >wedding. These printables have clean minimalist lines and designs. The collection will help you with the signage and printed parts of >the wedding. The collection has everything from Bridal Shower and Sangeet invitations to signs to help direct the flow of guests on the >day. The first part of the collection will be listed as printables. The second part of this collection will be editable, which means >you can personalize the file to fit your event. 
>
>To explain the why: I should probably start at the beginning. I grew up going to Indian weddings and have always loved the pomp and >ceremony that we put into our celebrations. As young kids, we see the bright colors on our outfits and our jewelry, everyone brings >their “A game!” We smell that wonderful smell of food being cooked in the Bridal house to prepare for all the guests that will stop by. >We smell the henna being applied and the feeling of excitement is in the air. Having a wedding in the house is lovely – but it takes a >lot to put it all together. 
>
>When it came time for my own wedding, I was a budget bride through and through. Most of the items on my bridal to-do list were recycled >or repurposed by things I found at the local craft stores. Some things like wedding signage or guestbook pages I simply created from >scratch and printed on my home computer. This collection is my way of bringing class and style to an event in an easy way at an >affordable price. 
>

## ☕ What is the story of my store ☕
>I have been designing and editing images ever since I first discovered Microsoft Paint on my new computer back in the '90s! The designs >you see here have been printed/cut into paper or vinyl and have been used at Indian weddings, baby and bridal showers that I have >hosted, given out as gifts by me or used in my children's school for Inclusive Schools Week. I am sharing them with the world in the >hopes that another creative person can take them and print or cut their own.
>I take pride in creating beautiful downloadable and printable files. If you need something custom made feel free to reach out using the >contact page or any of the social media accounts. I would love to create a unique design for you.
>
