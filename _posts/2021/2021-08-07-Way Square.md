What is a Digital Invitaiton? Can I print this invitation? What if I want to email it? Can I use the same file to send out zoom links? 


> Editing and sending or printing at home has never been this easy

 

## What are digital downloads
Digital downloads are files that you purchase online with the intent to use. Our files are available in PDF, PNG and SVG formats. 



Here is a link to Etsy's Download Guide [Click here](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013328108-Downloading-a-Digital-Item?segment=shopping).


## What is the difference between a digital download and an Electronic Virtual Invitation?
A digital download is a file you purchase and download to your own device. An online template such as the editable templates we provide are sent via a link.

Once you have completed your purchase the link to your virtual invitation will be there for you to edit and save your own file.
