# Desi Wedding Week Food And Snacks Ideas

Food for all those in between meals, all these snacks are great served with tea for your at home Indian themed event.


You will need:
Serving plates and napkins
Almonds, Pistachios, Cashew nuts
Namak Pare
Pastries or Bagels
Pakora or Samosa plate
Fruit bowl with pick up as you go fruit
Fruit plate with cut pieces of fruit
Make your own Ice Cream Sundae and Snack Bar
Ice Cream – Vanilla and at least two other flavors
Ice cream scoops
Sprinkles (give a few options here)
Baby Marshmallows
Baby gummy bears
Syrups – Chocolate, Strawberry, Caramel
Marciano cherries
Pre-popped plain popcorn for health conscious guests
Cake Pops
Day old or leftover cake
Melting Candy (found at grocery stores in the cake mix aisle)
Sprinkles
Cake pop sticks

> A parchment paper or surface to work on as it gets messy

A foam block or somewhere to stand the cake pop. As it dries you can add your sprinkles.
Mix up the cake with the frosting into a blender and buzz until cake can form hand made cake balls. Put in the fridge for 30 mins to cool. Follow the instructions on the candy melt to bring the candy coating color of your choice to a liquidy state. Push a cake pop stick into the cake ball, roll it around gently in the candy melt and place into the foam block so that the cake part is on the top. Cover with sprinkles or allow to dry and give it a different color as a second or partial coating. Have fun with this one!
