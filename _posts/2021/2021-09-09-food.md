>Image Description: On a wooden table is a zoomed in image of a printed sample sheet of Golden Diwali Diya Cards. Visible are two Golen Diya cards that are square with diya designs in the center and near the bottom of the square. Also pictured is a partial view of a rectangular card with small diya designs gracing the left side of the printable card. 

## Cake Pops Quick Recipe 
Day old or leftover cake
Melting Candy (found at grocery stores in the cake mix aisle)
Sprinkles
Sticks for cake pops (found in the bakery aisle or bakery supply store)
Optional: Crumbled pretzels or crushed candy cane

> As it becomes messy, you'll need parchment paper or another surface to work on.

We recommend using gloves to protect your hands and keep it clean during the coating process because it is challenging. The cake balls should be pressed into the cake pop stick before being covered with candy melt. Leaving them on the paper and inserting the cake pop stick halfway into the cake pop ball is the simplest way to accomplish this. Proceed with caution since the candy melt will be quite hot.

A bakery or grocery shop is a wonderful place to get a block or a stand for the cake pops. Allow the drippings to gather on a tray or plate below the cake pops as they are placed upside down in the foam block. You may add your sprinkles while the cake pops are drying by shaking them directly on each one. Use crumbled pretzels as sprinkles or crushed candy cane as sprinkling to get creative with your toppings.
In a blender, combine the cake and frosting and puree until the cake can be molded into hand-held cake balls and place on your parchment. Allow 30 minutes in the refrigerator to cool. To make the liquid, follow the directions on the candy melt packaging.
