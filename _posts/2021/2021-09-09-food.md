>All of these appetizers are delicious served with tea in between meals for an at-home Indian themed celebration.

# **Food Table ideas:**

**Namak Pare:** 
The words 'namak' and 'para' or 'pare' imply salt and pieces, respectively. As a result, the word namak pare literally translates to "salty bits" or "salty bites."
<br/>

**Shakkar Pare:**
Sweet snack of crispy, flaky, fried flour cookies coated with crystallized sugar. The Shakkar Pare are always a sweet and inviting treat for your guests. Traditionally these snacks are made in the wedding home the week of the wedding by the family of the couple. 

**Pastries or Bagels: served with cream cheese:**
Bagels are always a good go-to for the morning of a wedding. You can feed so many with very little cost. The downsides to using bagels on your table are: they have to be picked up fresh and younger kids may not eat them which leaves you with hungry kids. This is where the pastries or some small soft rolls and some bread/jam can go a long way.
<br/>

**Pakora or Samosa plate:**
On a wedding morning, nothing beats this! These delicacies go down so nicely with a cup of chaa ☕☕ or coffee and nourish everyone well. To serve the needs of the majority of your crowd, the table should offer a variety of spicy sauces, chutney, and ketchup.
<br/>

**Pick-up-as-you-go fruit in a fruit bowl or small individual cups:**
A large serving bowl or a large air tight container filled with fresh cut fruit might help keep the gathering moving if you're serving food in your own house or hotel room. If you're serving guests who will all gather in one place before moving on to the wedding or event, fill tiny paper cups with fruit and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.

[![Blue handmade cake pops](\images\portfolio\photo\food\4.jpg)](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TwoCupsOfChaa)


# Cake Pops Quick Recipe 
>Day old or leftover cake
>Melting Candy (found at grocery stores in the cake mix aisle)
>Sprinkles
>Sticks for cake pops (found in the bakery aisle or bakery supply store)
>Optional: Crumbled pretzels or crushed candy cane

> **As it becomes messy, you'll need parchment paper or another surface to work on.**

>We recommend using gloves to protect your hands and keep it clean during the coating process because it is challenging. The cake balls should be pressed into the cake pop stick before being covered with candy melt. Leaving them on the paper and inserting the cake pop stick halfway into the cake pop ball is the simplest way to accomplish this. Proceed with caution since the candy melt will be quite hot.

>A bakery or grocery shop is a wonderful place to get a block or a stand for the cake pops. Allow the drippings to gather on a tray or plate below the cake pops as they are placed upside down in the foam block. You may add your sprinkles while the cake pops are drying by shaking them directly on each one. Use crumbled pretzels as sprinkles or crushed candy cane as sprinkling to get creative with your toppings.
>In a blender, combine the cake and frosting and puree until the cake can be molded into hand-held cake balls and place on your parchment. Allow 30 minutes in the refrigerator to cool. To make the liquid, follow the directions on the candy melt packaging.

>As you prepare for your event, it's nice to mix a bit tradition with some fun. Add handwritten place cards and gift tags to your table decor if you're hosting an event.
