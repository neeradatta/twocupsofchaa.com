# Food and Snacks. 

Things might become hectic during the wedding week during South Asian weddings, so here are some food and snack suggestions to keep guests happy during the breaks.

>All of these appetizers are delicious served with tea in between meals for an at-home Indian themed celebration.

Image Description: A zoomed-in view of a printed sample sheet of Golden Diwali Diya Cards is shown on a wooden table. Two Golen Diya cards are shown, each of which is square and has diya patterns in the middle and near the bottom. A portion of a rectangle card with little diya motifs adorning the left side of the downloadable card is also shown.


# **Food Table ideas:**

Namak Pare: 
The words 'namak' and 'para' or 'pare' imply salt and pieces, respectively. As a result, the word namak pare literally translates to "salty bits" or "salty bites."
<br/>
Pastries or Bagels: served with cream cheese. 
<br/>
Pakora or Samosa plate: Served with ketchup or chutney.
<br/>
Pick-up-as-you-go fruit in a fruit bowl or small individual cups
<br/>

## Cake Pops Quick Recipe 
Day old or leftover cake
Melting Candy (found at grocery stores in the cake mix aisle)
Sprinkles
Sticks for cake pops (found in the bakery aisle or bakery supply store)
Optional: Crumbled pretzels or crushed candy cane

> **As it becomes messy, you'll need parchment paper or another surface to work on.**

We recommend using gloves to protect your hands and keep it clean during the coating process because it is challenging. The cake balls should be pressed into the cake pop stick before being covered with candy melt. Leaving them on the paper and inserting the cake pop stick halfway into the cake pop ball is the simplest way to accomplish this. Proceed with caution since the candy melt will be quite hot.

A bakery or grocery shop is a wonderful place to get a block or a stand for the cake pops. Allow the drippings to gather on a tray or plate below the cake pops as they are placed upside down in the foam block. You may add your sprinkles while the cake pops are drying by shaking them directly on each one. Use crumbled pretzels as sprinkles or crushed candy cane as sprinkling to get creative with your toppings.
In a blender, combine the cake and frosting and puree until the cake can be molded into hand-held cake balls and place on your parchment. Allow 30 minutes in the refrigerator to cool. To make the liquid, follow the directions on the candy melt packaging.


As you prepare for your event, it's nice to mix a bit tradition with some fun. Add handwritten place cards and gift tags to your table decor if you're hosting an event.
