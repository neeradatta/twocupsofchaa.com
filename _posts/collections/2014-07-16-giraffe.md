Meet Geoffrey, he is my silly smiling goofy giraffe design. Giraffes are marvelous, tall and proud creatures! Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances. This giraffe is in here because my eldest child collected them when she was little. I loved elephants, she loved giraffe’s – it was an awesome mommy-daughter duo! While her tastes have changed this remains an animal that is near and dear to my heart.
