The Reds Collection is a selection of files that I have put together to help you put together different aspects of your wedding. While the images are through an Indian lens they can certainly be used for events of all kinds. The collection will help you with the signage and printed parts of the wedding. The collection has everything from Bridal Shower and Sangeet invitations to signs to help direct the flow of guests on the day. The first part of the collection will be listed as printables. The second part of this collection will be editable, which means you can personalize the file to fit your event.

To explain the why: I should probably start at the beginning. I grew up going to Indian weddings and have always loved the pomp and ceremony that we put into our celebrations. As young kids we see the bright colors on our outfits and our jewelry, everyone brings their “A game!” We smell that wonderful smell of food being cooked in the Bridal house to prepare for all the guests that will stop by. We smell the henna being applied and the feeling of excitement is in the air. Having a wedding in the house is lovely – but it takes a lot to put it all together.

When it came time to my own wedding, I was a budget bride through-and-through. Most of the items on my bridal to-do-list were recycled or repurposed by things I found at the local craft stores. Some things like wedding signage or guestbook pages I simply created from scratch and printed on my home computer. This collection is my way of bringing class and style to an event in an easy way at an affordable price.
