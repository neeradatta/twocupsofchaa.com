This is Paquito my Majestic Peacock, he is an incredibly beautiful and proud peacock I had the good fortune of meeting recently. While Paquito doesn’t usually dance for strangers he did for me. It was a truly breathtaking moment that I won’t ever forget – I am in awe of the closeup pictures and videos he allowed me to take of him dancing. I have always been drawn to animals who walk this earth with grace, this peacock was no exception. He knows he is magnificent! Peacocks love the limelight, the sight of a dancing peacock is something you don't forget. The males sport highly ornamental feathers in their train. As an artist, there are so many details to pull from when working with this animal. When designing this peacock, I wanted to feature the eyes in his plumage and showcase how big his train is. I hope he brings you as much joy as he does to me.
