> ## ☕ What's the backstory behind the Red Diya Printable Bundle? ☕

>The Red Diya Printable Collection is a collection of files put together to assist you with various elements of your wedding planning. >While the photographs are shot through an Indian lens, they may be used for a variety of events. The collection will assist you with >the wedding signs and printed materials. From Bridal Shower and Sangeet invites to signage to assist control the flow of visitors on >the big day, the collection has it all.
>
>To understand the why, let's start at the beginning: our generation grew up attending many Indian weddings, and we've always admired >the pomp and circumstance that we put into our celebrations. As youngsters, we notice the vibrant colors on our costumes and jewelry, >and everyone puts their "A" game on! The lovely fragrance of food being prepared for all of the guests expected to come to the Bridal >home. There's a flutter of excitement in the air as we smell the henna being applied. While having a pre-wedding event at home is >wonderful, planning one takes a significant amount of time and effort. All of these events served as inspiration for this collection; >we hope you enjoy using these files at your event as much as we did. 
>
>When it came to planning my own wedding, I was a budget bride to the heart. The majority of the items on my bridal to-do list were >reused or upcycled from items I acquired at local craft stores. I produced certain things from scratch, such as wedding signs and >guestbook pages, and printed them on my home computer. This collection is my way of bringing quality and flair to an event without >going overboard by relying on years of expertise in a simple and cost-effective approach.

>The why: I grew up going to weddings and have always loved the pomp and ceremony that we put into our celebrations. As young kids we >remember seeing the bright colors on our outfits and our jewelry, everyone brings their “A game!” We smell that wonderful smell of food >being cooked in the Bridal house to prepare for all the guests that will stop by. Having a wedding in the house is lovely – but it >takes a lot to put it all together.

>When it came time to my own mixed with the smell of treats being rustled up in the kitchen wedding, I was a budget bride >through-and-through. Most of the items on my bridal to-do-list were recycled or repurposed by things I found at the local craft stores. >Some things like wedding signage or guestbook pages I simply created from scratch and printed on my home computer. This collection is >my way of bringing class and style to an event in an easy way at an affordable price.
