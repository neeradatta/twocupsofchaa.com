> ### ☕☕ What is the story of this animal? 

Meet our noble elephant! For as far back as I can remember I have been in awe of elephants. Elephants are strong, powerful yet graceful animals. When I see an image of an elephant they bring me peace so I kept the lines simple yet powerful. My elephant art collection is inspired by the figurines and paintings I have either been given or collected over the years.
