## ☕What is this animal's backstory? ☕

>Our stunning elephant SVG PDF and PNG collection is now available! Elephants have always fascinated me, ever as I can remember. Elephants are >enormous, powerful, and graceful animals. I find it relaxing to observe an elephant image in a welcoming environment. Because elephants emanate >strength, I kept the lines simple yet forceful. My elephant art collection is made up of miniatures and paintings that I've collected throughout >the years, this digital collection is an ode to the elephant.
