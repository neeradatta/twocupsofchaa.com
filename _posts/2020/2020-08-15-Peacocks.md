Meet Paquito the Majestic Peacock, an exceptionally gorgeous and regal peacock that I had the pleasure of meeting in recent years. Paquito lives with his growing family, who are some of the most lovely creatures I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.

> ### ☕What's the backstory behind this animal's design?☕
<br/>

Paquito, my Majestic Peacock, is a wonderfully gorgeous and proud peacock that I recently had the pleasure of meeting. Paquito seldom dances for strangers, but he did so beautifully ffor me. It was a genuinely magnificent experience that I will never forget, and I am still in awe of the closeup photos and videos of him dancing that he permitted me to shoot. I've always been fascinated to creatures that gracefully tread the land, and this peacock was no different. He is very aware of his magnificence!

Peacocks enjoy being in the spotlight, and the sight of a dancing peacock is unforgettable. In their train, the males have exceedingly decorative feathers. When dealing with this animal as an artist, there are so many details to draw from. I wanted to emphasize the eyeballs in his plumage and the size of his train when developing this digital peacock. I hope he gives you as much pleasure as he gives me.
