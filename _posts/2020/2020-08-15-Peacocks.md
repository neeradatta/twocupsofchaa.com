### ☕What's the backstory behind this animal's design?☕
>Paquito, my Majestic Peacock, is a wonderfully gorgeous and proud peacock that I recently had the pleasure of meeting. Paquito seldom >dances for strangers, but he did so beautifully ffor me. It was a genuinely magnificent experience that I will never forget, and I am >still in awe of the closeup photos and videos of him dancing that he permitted me to shoot. I've always been fascinated to creatures >that gracefully tread the land, and this peacock was no different. He is very aware of his magnificence!
>
>Peacocks enjoy being in the spotlight, and the sight of a dancing peacock is unforgettable. In their train, the males have exceedingly >decorative feathers. When dealing with this animal as an artist, there are so many details to draw from. I wanted to emphasize the >eyeballs in his plumage and the size of his train when developing this digital peacock. I hope he gives you as much pleasure as he >gives me.
