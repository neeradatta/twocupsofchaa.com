### â˜•What is the story of this animal?â˜•

>Giraffes, with their high legs and lengthy necks, are the world's tallest animals. A giraffe's legs alone are roughly 6 feet long, making it higher than many humans. Giraffes can run as fast as 35 miles per hour over short distances and cruise at 10 miles per hour over extended distances because to their long legs. My eldest child collected giraffes when she was younger, which is whyÂ this designÂ is in here. It was a great mommy-daughter pair since I adored elephants and she loved giraffes. While her preferences have evolved, she is still an animal that holds a special place in my heart.

>This Giraffe design was created with handmade gifts and craft in mind. The file may be used to produce stunning vinyl or paper embellishments to your projects using a cricut or other cutting machine.

### â˜•â˜• What is the story of my store 

>I have been designing and editing images ever since I first discovered Microsoft Paint on my new computer back in the '90s! The designs you see here have been cut into paper or vinyl and have been printed to be used at Indian weddings, baby and bridal showers that I have hosted, given out as gifts by me or used in my children's school for Inclusive Schools Week. I am sharing them with the world in the hopes that another creative person can take them and print or cut their own.
