> ### ☕☕ What is the story of this animal? 

Meet Geoffrey, he is my silly smiling Goofy Giraffe design. Giraffes are marvelous, tall and proud creatures!

Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.

This giraffe is in here because my eldest child collected them when she was little. I loved elephants, she loved giraffe’s – it was an awesome mommy-daughter duo! While her tastes have changed this remains an animal that is near and dear to my heart.

> ### ☕☕ What is the story of my store 

I have been designing and editing images ever since I first discovered Microsoft Paint on my new computer back in the '90s! The designs you see here have been cut into paper or vinyl and have been printed to be used at Indian weddings, baby and bridal showers that I have hosted, given out as gifts by me or used in my children's school for Inclusive Schools Week. I am sharing them with the world in the hopes that another creative person can take them and print or cut their own.
