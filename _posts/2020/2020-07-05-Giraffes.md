## The Goofy Giraffe Collection

 Meet George he is a whimsical smiling
giraffe. Giraffes are marvelous and tall creatures! A giraffe made it into my collection
because my eldest child collected them when she was little. I loved elephants, she loved
giraffe’s – it was an awesome mommy-daughter duo! While her tastes have changed this still
remains an animal that is near and dear to my heart.
